# CP1404 Assignment 2: Travel Tracker 2.0 by YOURNAME

_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own name/details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
...  
It took about two to three days, one of which was used to modify and improve my Assignment 1, place.py, and placecollection.py, while the rest was written as main and app.kv

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
The code is clean and orderly

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
Too many errors occurred midway, and there were some differences in appearance between the final product and the sample

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
 Breaking down the tasks into smaller manageable units, using version control systems, and writing modular code
## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
Of course, with the experience of completing the task this time, it will definitely be faster and better next time

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
I basically only used the correction and reference functions provided by pychart

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
When writing main.py, I have encountered numerous bugs due to formatting differences between certain statements in place.py and placecollection.py. To address these bugs, I had to go over and over my code and try to rewrite it
## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
Classes provide a way to organize code and data into reusable and modular components. By encapsulating data and functionality within classes, you can achieve better code organization, improve code reusability, and enhance maintainability. Classes enable you to create objects with defined properties and behaviors, making the code more intuitive and easier to work with. In this project, using classes such as Place and PlaceCollection allows you to represent and manage places in a structured and efficient manner.
